Auto AutoAnswer
==============

Open Source Android App forked from Google Code()


First, I introduce the **AutoAnswer** Android app, which is open source project hosted in [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/auto-answer/).
That AutoAnswer app was created by [EverySoft](http://www.everysoft.com).

I wanted that AutoAnswer can communicate with Android's automation apps such as Tasker or Locale by way of plugin, so I added additional automizing feature to original app. That's the reason why I prefixed duplicated **Auto** to app's name. And then I contacted the project owner by email, but in no vain. Email was returned with broken message.

So I've uploaded the modified sources into github and you can get this app for free in Google's Playstore.
My modification is just only one Receiver class, so my knowledge about original app's routines about call and bluetooth interruption is a very small bit.

If this app is not working on your device, then that' the end. :( You shoud find another good apps.


If you use an automation app like Tasker or Locale, you can get my related free plugin in PlayStore.
